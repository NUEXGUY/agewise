            Reaching overhead can indeed strain your shoulder. It might help to avoid or modify that movement for a bit. Also, some gentle shoulder stretches and strengthening exercises can improve your mobility and reduce pain. Would you like me to suggest a few?

            Yes, reaching overhead tends to make it worse.
